# Sh4ck: A Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Credit card frauds are a more severe issue for financial instituitions in the modern digital age. For instance, in 2018, it [cost approximately &euro;2 billion](#1) in the Single European Payment Area alone. 

In this project, I will play a "full-stack" data scientist for a financial institution to implement a complete fraud detection system by accomplishing the following tasks:

- [ ] Simulate daily transactions using a [transaction data simulator](#1) and store it on a relational database.

- [ ] Use historical data to train and build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions.

- [ ] Deploy the model and use it to predict frauds in real-time.
