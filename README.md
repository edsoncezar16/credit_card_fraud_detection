# Sh4ck: A Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Credit card frauds are a more severe issue for financial institutions in the modern digital age. For instance, in 2018, it [cost approximately &euro;2 billion](#1) in the Single European Payment Area alone. 

With the volume and velocity of the transaction data of financial institutions, an ML-based solution to this problem is mandatory. This approach accouts for both the technical feasibility of the task and trustworthy of customers.

In this project, I play a data scientist working for a financial institution to, ultimately, implement a complete fraud detection system by accomplishing the following tasks:

- [ ] Simulate daily transactions using a [transaction data simulator](#1) (given that, for confidentiality reasons, it is hard to find publicly available fraud detection data with meaningful features) and store it in a relational database.

- [ ] Use historical data to train and build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions.

- [ ] Deploy the model and use it to predict frauds in real-time.

- [ ] Translate the model performance into the financial impact generated by the solution.

The above tasks require a sophisticated level of both technical and business knowledge. Based on that, I will first complete a simpler version of the goals to build upon the skills developed in this stage to achieve the desired outcome:

- [x] Simulate transactions over a fixed period using a transaction data simulator.

- [ ] Use the simulated data to train and build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions.

- [ ] Deploy the model and use it to assess whether a transaction entered by the user is fraudulent or not.

- [ ] Translate the model performance into the financial impact generated by the solution.
